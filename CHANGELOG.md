# CHANGELOG

2017/07/15
==========
- Update SoundfontPlayer to latest version - fix instrument names exception
- Use npm for dependencies and scripts - I don't like to pollute the global npm packages, so I created a package.json to download the dependencies locally (purescript, pulp, bower) and create some scripts to build the project and the example.
